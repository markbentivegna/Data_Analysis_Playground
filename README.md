## Job Posting Spam

I found an interesting dataset containing a list of 18,000 job postings, many of which were spam postings. Using text analysis, I was able to use Naive Bayes theorem to identify spam postings with an accuracy of over 95%.

## Titanic Survival Rate

One of the more popular datasets to explore is the Titanic survival dataset. Looking at the following key features, I was able to predict who would survive in the test dataset with 75% accuracy:
  ```
   Class
   Sex
   Fare
  ```
  
Class had a correlation coefficient of about 0.55 and sex had a score of about -0.35 because first class was much more likely to survive than third class.
